        </p>
        <p>Keerthi Pavan Valluri is my name. I have been working as a Network Engineer for the past 2 years and moved to Canada to pursue my post-graduation in Mobile Application Design & Development at Lambton College, Toronto. I like to develop applications for both Android and iOS and also like to debug the applications. I usually love to develop both back end and front end in the applications which made me contribute to both in my academic projects. With some industry experience in Information Technology, I have acquired knowledge about the Mobile Application business.<br><br>
        In this day and age, many people are inseperable from their mobile devices. Indeed, the infrastructure and framework of entire nations are built upon software. I first became fascinated with coding at the age of sixteen, and my appreciation of its applications have only grown as I have progressed through my education in the field. My computer science courses have helped me to better understand the logic and complex circuitry underlying the ability to convert code to action, and this is why I am persuing my post-graduation in Toronto, Canada.</p>
